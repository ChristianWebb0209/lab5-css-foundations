### Lab 5 - css foundations

This lab is about recreating a login page, while making sure to use good HTML fundamentals and using css to make it match visually.

## Implementation approach

My approach was looking at the reference image to decide a good way to structure the html, then building the html, then styling, until finally cross referencing to fine tune the styling.

## Challenges

For me design and artistic instinct are not strongsuits, so naturally I struggled with getting everything looking right and spent a lot of time on details. I also struggled with thinking of good naming conventions. I decided on lowercase with dashes for the id names, and for what to name my components, I made them follow each other, so main-section, form-section, and info-section, and components like form-actions and info-description all follow this style of container first (form, area, main) then name second (description, actions).

## Design decisions

The main html structure had one main div container with the two sections as its children. this made it intuitive to make the rounded corners around just the main div, and the two children divs could easily be formatted as columns side by side.
